You need to hire software engineers so you can start new projects and staff existing ones. Lately you&rsquo;ve become disheartened with recruiting and have spent very little time on it. You feel that the way you present yourself makes it a hopeless waste of time to search for the kinds of engineers you&rsquo;d want to hire. Your network feels tapped out. You&rsquo;ve opted out of the Silicon Valley hype cycle, which makes it harder for engineers to hear about you.</p><h2>There&rsquo;s hope</h2><p>A healthy flowing pipeline of relevant, high-quality, and diverse engineering candidates will solve your hiring problems. Large parts of your network that you have not considered remain untapped. You will attract high quality candidates with job descriptions that show you as bootstrapped and profitable.</p><p>You are much more attractive to high quality candidates than you realize. You are a practical engineer&rsquo;s dream: your software concretely relieves pain, saves time, and saves money for your customers and co-workers. Your hiring pipeline problems will be gone, and you&rsquo;ll be able to pick from an enthusiastic and diverse crowd of engineers, clamoring to work with you. You&rsquo;ll have the long-term foundation you need to grow your team, and hear excitement in candidate&rsquo;s voices even before you&rsquo;ve pitched them on working with you.</p><h2>Who are we looking for?</h2><p>We&rsquo;re not looking for new graduates, and we aren&rsquo;t hiring interns. We&rsquo;re looking for junior or mid-level engineers who already have at least one engineering job under their belt. You have a solid idea of the salary range you&rsquo;re willing to offer, and you&rsquo;re willing to compensate competitively.</p><h2>How will we gauge success in our work together?</h2><p>We&apos;ll know if our efforts are working if...</p><ul><li>Engineers (and designers) reply to us</li><li>We get into conversations with candidates about interviews</li><li>We get interviews scheduled with candidates</li><li>Rejected candidates refer their friends</li><li>Candidates are given offers</li><li>Candidates accept offers</li><li>Candidates and current team agree to refer others</li></ul><h2>Methodology and Options</h2><h2>Option A: Lead Generation</h2><p>We will pursue a mix of outreach strategies that we feel will be the most effective at bringing in candidates who meet your hiring guidelines. We&rsquo;ll discuss and decide on a plan of action when the engagement starts. We will work from my list of eleven channels for hiring engineers, which are neglected by most companies and recruiters. These channels will help you reach thousands or tens of thousands of engineers, depending on the size of your team.</p><p>Most recruiters see reply rates of around 2%. Past clients have seen 50% reply rate from engineers. 17% of everyone we contacted wanted to speak with my client about the position.</p><p>In all this work, we will use language that is inclusive, empathetic, and does not drive away candidates from non-traditional engineering backgrounds.</p><p><em>Guarantee: If you don't feel we're making progress towards our business outcomes I will return your investment for the most recent month.</em></p><h2>Option B: Lead Generation, Job Descriptions, and CTO Interview</h2><p><em>Includes option A.</em></p><p>I will write job descriptions for each position. Through an interview with you, the CTO, we will expose key parts of your engineering practices and company culture. The interview will attract experienced engineers who care about their business impact, as well as diverse candidates. I will perform ongoing adjustments and course corrections to the messaging based on what we learn from our lead generation work and candidate feedback.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll vastly increase your top-of-funnel by lightly changing your hiring process, opening the floodgates to engineers who have strong experience and open source projects. This will also open the doors to overlooked engineers who are perfectly good at engineering, but don&rsquo;t present themselves well.</p><p>We will revive those in your network who&rsquo;ve stopped giving referrals. Ivan Kirigin of YesGraph notes &ldquo;The common guess is [friends and employees stop referring] because they run out of contacts. Nope, consistent feedback has been that an employee has a bad experience and doesn&rsquo;t want to do it again. It can be literally as simple as telling the employee who made the referral the current status of the candidate. All you need is more transparency, even if the candidate is rejected.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Guarantee: If you don't feel we're making progress towards our business outcomes I will return your investment for the most recent month.</em></p><h2>Option C: Lead Generation, Job Descriptions, CTO Interview, and Create a Fanbase for You the CTO</h2><p><i>Includes option A and B.</i></p><p>I will create a report on how to fix your various hiring sites and combine them, so a candidate can learn everything they need to know about your company in one place.</p><p>We will do head-shots similar to <a href="http://neo-summon.herokuapp.com">Neo's Summon</a>, in a way that makes sense for your company, and create a profile on each of your current team-members. When candidates concretely know who they want to learn from, they&rsquo;ll be drawn to you for what their career could become with the help of their co-workers. They&rsquo;ll do their work as described, and grow within the company. You&rsquo;ll avoid the problem that most high growth companies have with their culture: when you add people rapidly, learning does not transfer quickly enough and your company begins to operate in less than ideal ways. Your culture will mature with greater health due to increased knowledge transfer.</p><p>We will schedule you to speak on your industry&rsquo;s podcasts, discussing the interesting technical and business aspects of your company. Engineers who listen to these podcasts will consider you a player in the space, and investigate working with you. You will become a mini-internet celebrity.</p><p>We will set up a landing page and educational drip email campaign for these listeners to read more about engineering at your company. They will gradually learn more about your engineering and culture, stoking their desire to work with you. I will record conversations with you on the most interesting parts of your business, transcribe them, and make three installments that every new subscriber receives over the course of three weeks. Each installment will note that you are hiring, and the fourth installment will be dedicated to information on working with you. All emails will appear to be sent from you, the CTO, making it effortless for interested candidates to start conversations.</p><h2>How many conversations are needed to make the hire?</h2><p>This depends on who you're looking for and demand. Past clients made hires from between 30 and 120 conversations.</p><p>We'd start as many conversations with relevant, quality engineers as you could handle. Once you get overwhelmed and have a good feeling that at least one of the candidates will accept, we'd pause the incoming candidates. Instead you'd get advice on closing the engineers you are speaking with. You'd also get tips to improve your hiring process.</p><h2>How long does it take to make a hire?</h2><p>It depends heavily on what technologies and experience you're looking for.</p><h2>Do you charge a placement fee?</h2><p>No. Not for monthly pricing.</p><h2>Will you besmirch our company brand?</h2><p>No. Speaking and writing like a stereotypical recruiter will negatively impact candidate interest and conversions. Staying on-brand and authentic is very good for hitting our business outcomes.</p><h2>Why hire now?</h2><p>We want to hire ASAP. You have unallocated budget for multiple hires that is burning a large hole in your pocket.</p><h2>Why get more candidates in your hiring pipeline?</h2><p>Outreach will extricate you from your current situation: too few applicants. Waiting for applicants is not enough to find the type of engineer you&rsquo;re looking for, at the speed you need to hire.</p><h2 id="-we-hired-two-awesome-engineers-after-working-for-a-total-of-6-weeks-with-david-">&quot;We hired two awesome engineers after working for a total of 6 weeks with David.&quot;</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We were uncertain about the results and feared the tone of writing wouldn&#39;t sound like our own. <strong>When the tone of writing didn&#39;t match mine, it was better.</strong> Seriously everyone seemed to enjoy the way David communicated about the job description. I got <strong>multiple unsolicited compliments.</strong> I feel guilty about it.</p>
<p>Extensive time went into researching the culture and job so David could give the correct description to candidates.</p>
<p>David was caring and responsive to concerns while carefully explaining why he did things certain ways. An adjustable email pattern made it so I could slip into an email thread while the noise was filtered by David. People liked interacting with David.</p>
<p>I was skeptical about working with David because he didn&#39;t have the same vibes as recruiters that I have come into contact with in the past. His work with us got us great results, in part because of his engineering background. We hired him specifically to help us find experienced engineers. We saw that <strong>half of our engineering candidates replied to us,</strong> and <strong>1 in 6 overall wanted to get on the phone with me.</strong> Calls with candidates have been great, and <strong>people have a positive impression before they get onto the call.</strong> Engineers seem to love us because of how David wrote about us. We hired two awesome engineers after working for a total of 6 weeks with David. We are very happy with EngineerOverflow and would work with David again.&quot;</p>

<p>– Eric, CTO of Scalable Press (a bootstrapped and profitable company in San Francisco)</p>
<img src="/images/eric.jpg" alt="Eric" height="150" class="testimonial"/><p><strong>Update:</strong> Since he wrote this, he&#39;s hired another two engineers because of me, for a total of four. Their engineering team&#39;s gender diversity has increased ∞&#8288;%, from zero women to two out of nine.</p>
<h2>About David Trejo</h2><p>Brown Computer Science and two years in the software engineering industry taught me what to look for in a job, and what other engineers are looking for in their work. Since working in software, I&rsquo;ve learned to conduct sales and marketing for my consulting services in a way that is <strong>pleasant</strong> and is <strong>not</strong> sales-y nor filled with marketing language that drives people away. Outreach for my other clients and myself frequently elicits replies saying &ldquo;thank you for the email&rdquo; or &ldquo;thank you for the follow-up.&rdquo; These same strategies will work well with engineers. We will not trip their spidey sense with spammy emails. I have experience emailing large numbers of people in a personal way. My experience in my other consulting work has taught me how to ask questions of customers and figure out why they bought from my clients. We will apply the same principles to discover why your current team decided to work with you. The reasons your team loves your company will make our job ads and descriptions persuasive on a level that few companies achieve.</p><h2>Terms and Conditions</h2><p>With a few open positions for engineers, you have <em>conservatively</em> $300,000 to $1,050,000 annually waiting to be invested back into your company. Every day without them delays new projects whose ROI must be over $900,000 annually (otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t want to hire anyone). Let&rsquo;s get ourselves some new hires and give you the growth you deserve.</p><p>A deposit for the first month must be paid in full on acceptance to schedule the project. Your investment is $6,500.00 USD per month for option C, $5,100.00 USD per month for option B, and $4,100.00 USD per month for option A. The fee is due at the start of each 30 day period to continue our work together.</p><p>My guarantee for any option you choose: <em>If you don't feel we're making progress towards our business outcomes I will return your investment for the most recent month.</em>
